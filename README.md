Here I will be updating all homeworks of MMoP - UNMSM - FCM

Animations made using Python and IDE PyCharm Community Ver.

Animation main functions:

  -streamlines -> receive point in plane and return the direction of the vector

  -get_color_from_mag -> receive the norm of the vector and return a color in order to set the color gradients
  
  -get_div_factor_from_mag -> if the vector field plotted is hard to see, this function receives the norm and give a factor to rescale the vector
  
  -normal -> receive a point in plane and return a vector that will be drawed in the plane

Manim library installation is required (I installed Manimce via Chocolatey)

MiKTeX installation is required to renderize LaTeX format
